Hi, my name is Neilson Maknarakham. I'm a product of the Portland Code School (PCS). Prior to PCS, my educational background was in chemistry and human physiology. My code experience has been primarily focused on web development. At PCS, we used Ruby on Rails for our projects, with a little JavaScript here and there.

Currently I work in a chemistry laboratory testing metal alloys and tinker with machines. Off the clock, I like to use Python to see if I could parse data to make graphs and tell awesome stories. When I'm not working after work, I like to play board games, cook, read, watch sports, and walk everywhere.

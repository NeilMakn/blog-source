#### www.nkwedding.us

See [here](http://www.nkwedding.us)

Code [here](https://github.com/NeilMakn/wedding_static_site)

I needed a static site to share with friends and family about my upcoming wedding. I used Cactus, a quick static site generator, and the CSS framework Foundation to get it done. Some use of JavaScript and jQuery to load images and animate page scrolling.

#### Humans.txt Script

Code [here](https://github.com/NeilMakn/humans_txt/blob/master/humans_txt.rb)

For a job application, I made this Ruby script that would download the humans.txt file for a given website to a specified directory.

#### Crowd Compass Dashboard

Code [here](https://github.com/NeilMakn/wavelet_dash)

I spent a week at Crowd Compass with four other students from the Portland Code School developing a dashboard for their Operations department. We built the dashboard using a Sinatra based framework called Dashing. In my role, I connected our application with a Graphite server so that data could be received and displayed. I also tweaked Dashing's widgets with JavaScript so their colors would change if certain tresholds were reached.
